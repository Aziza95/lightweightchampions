LED brightness, Controlled with two buttons
In this exemple we used two buttons instead of one potantiometer to control LED brightness.

You will need: 
1. LED
2. 220 Ohm resistor
3. Arduino UNO
4. Push buttons
5. Breadboard

Two push buttons used for controling LED brightness.
The push button on pin 8 raises LED's brightness. The pushbutton on pin 9 lowers the LED's brightness.

How it works: 
Push bottun that increase the brightness would be implemented in the button ( picture of the button is in the folder).
If user press the button forcefully this button got triggered, and if user press the button gently the other one do. This way the user could control
LED brightness.
