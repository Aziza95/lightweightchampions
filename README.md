# lightweightchampions . Interaction design - Light project

In this respository we have tried to develop and expand x amount of examples to explore different concepts of lights, from switches to dimmers. We have also explored changing hues and using lights with voice commands.

We explored a concept of hands-free interactions, all of the examples are aimed at one or two specific body interactions such as elbow, foot, knee, hip and voice. 

# Here is a short description of all the examples: 

We have one example with a elbow switch that uses arduino code to turns on/off led lights connected to the ardunio. And a dimmer, that uses serial bridge and receieves data from a potentiometer and changes the brightness/changes in color of the browsers background. 

We have two examples of foot pedals, one example that only uses arduino code and one that uses motion stream. They can also work together at the same time they're simly not interconnected. The arduino example changes between four different colors of led lights connected to the arduino, using four different four cases. The motions stream example displays the simulation of dimming of the light in the browser through the server. As the pedal detects changes in the gamma rotations it starts to dim the screen from white to black. 

We have one example that controls the hue as well as the brightness of the hue in arduino code. We have four leds connnected to arduino that uses the Adafruit Neo-pixel library connected to two potentiometers, one controlling the brightness of the hue and one that controls the hue. 

We have one example that uses voice commands to control the led light connected to the arduino. The examples uses an speech recognition API called Annyang. It works with commands like, "lights on/off" to turn on the led. 

We have one example that controls led lights by turning off/on, but also uses serial bridge to control the dimming of the screen on the browsers through the touch of the touch-pad surface.
